Registers:
0 - reserved for 0
1-4 - available
5 - reserved for stack frame calculations
6 - reserved for top of stack
7 - reserved for program counter

Stack Frame:
ret addr
Register contents 1-4
Arguments
Num arguments

DMEM:
Check main for number of arguments and store in r6 as top of stack
might do register overload at bottom if registers full, since we only have 4 registers available

IMEM:
It looks like our code will have to go backwards and create all the functions first,
then main, then the bootstrap.There's not a great way to go back and edit the addresses.
