    The overall theme of the functions are that our computer is imitating a young child/children.
    fingerCounter represents a child who can only count on their fingers, so when they are given a number
    they have to find the value of that number based on the number of 1's they have to add to reach it.
    imRightYoureWrong represents two siblings arguing about which one of them is right, until their parent angrily
    reprimands them.
    notBool and angryParent are helper functions to imRightYoureWrong *)
