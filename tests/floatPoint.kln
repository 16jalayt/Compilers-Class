(*The purpose of this program is to print out the numbers following the decimal point of a 
    floating point number. As Klein does cannot handle floating point values, I thought it would
    be interesting and challenging to write a program that can print those numbers out. As    
    Klein's Syntax does not specify whether or not the print statement prints onto a new line
    or continues printing on the same line, I am operating on the assumption that the integers
    printed by this function are all printed on the same line, such that the function call 
    floatPoint(10, 3) would produce 33333333... and so on. I used the MOD function provided
    in class as helper code. *)


function floatPoint(x : integer, y : integer) : boolean
if x-y = y
then printNum( 0 )
else 
	if (0 < x-y) and  (x-y < y)
	then 
		if 0 = MOD((x-y)*10, y)
		then printNum(((x-y)*10)/y)
		else printNumRecurse(((x-y)*10), y)
	else floatPoint( x-y, y)

function printNum(n : integer) : boolean
print( n )
true

function printNumRecurse(n : integer, m : integer) : boolean
print( n/m )
floatPoint(n, m)

function MOD( m : integer,  n : integer) : integer
(* standard library function *)
m - m/n * n
